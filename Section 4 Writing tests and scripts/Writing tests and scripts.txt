Global variables

variables has value en scope


initial value vs current value
if you give in an inital value it will transfer it to the current value and if you change the current value it will not transfer it to the current value


Pre-request scripts
ideal for making your requests dynamic, usually used in combination with variables, similar to test scripts

Environment variables
ideal when working with different servers and is a good alternative to global variables

collection variables
tied to a collection
cannot be updated using scripts
ideal for storing some constants that do not change during the execution

data variables
used when working with multiple data-sets
exist only during the execution of an iteration
can only be set from a CSV or a JSON file
