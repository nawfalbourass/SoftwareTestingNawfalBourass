steps to write assertions:
parse the response body
write a test

parsing the response body

response body type:
json > pm.response.json() is the most common
xml > xml2json(responseBody)
html > cheerio(pm.response.text())
plain-text > pm.response.text()
csv > csv-parse/lib/sync

assertions

So far we have only looked into the status code and the response body for writing tests. But you can also make assertions on the headers or cookies.
