Writing API tests

What is a test: is just a simple assertion (you just check a value from the response against an expected value)
Example the response can be the statuscode.

I tried to run a test on postman that already exist in postman just to see how it works (scrn1)
Then I made it fall on purpose by adding random word in de url. I saw then that the test failed the status code was 404 not found. (scrn2)
